### Purpose

This homework is to determine office hours.

### Grading

Grading will be done as a check/no check for turning in your work. If you are stressed about time, please give yourself an extension.

## Questions


### Question 1

Please complete the [following when2meet poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?34058570-P2Ml9) so that we can schedule office hours. Please use a unique identifier (does not have to be your name), so that I can make sure each student can attend at least one office hour.

### Question 2

Completion of this question is only necessary if you have accommodations. If you have any learning accommodations, please email me about your needs. I should receive a direct email from the Office of Student Access, but it is important that we discuss how accommodations will translate to our class. If you plan to seek accommodations, but do not have the formal document yet, please let me know!

I highly suggest that you make an appointment with a learning specialist through [Student Academic Support Services](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/Student_Support)! If you often need more time on a test, struggle to focus in class, or noticed a difference between your learning style and typical styles offered in school, **talk to academic support services and see if you qualify for accommodations!** Most professors should be working towards an inclusive classroom, but this is the best way to insure you get the learning environment you need!
