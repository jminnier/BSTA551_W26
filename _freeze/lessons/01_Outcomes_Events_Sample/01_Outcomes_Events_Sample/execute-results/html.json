Define basic terms related to events such as events, outcomes, and sample space.\n\n2.  Use proper set notation for events\n\n3.  Characterize possible outcomes, when something random occurs\n\n4.  Describe events into which outcomes can be grouped\n\n5.  Define important terms and rules within set theory such as unions, intersections, complements, mutually exclusive, and De Morgan's Laws\n\n## Where are we?\n\n![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Tossing One Coin (Outcomes, Events, and Sample Space)\n\n## Coin Toss Example: 1 coin (1/3)\n\n**Suppose you toss one coin.**\n\n-   What are the possible outcomes?\n\n     \n\n-   What is the sample space?\n\n     \n\n-   What are the possible events?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Coin Toss Example: 1 coin (2/3)\n\n**Suppose you toss one coin.**\n\n-   What are the possible outcomes?\n\n    -   Heads ($H$)\n\n    -   Tails ($T$)\n\n \n\n::: fact\n::: fact-title\nNote\n:::\n\n::: fact-cont\nWhen something happens at random, such as a coin toss, there are several possible outcomes, and *exactly one* of the outcomes will occur.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Definitions: Sample Space and Events\n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Sample Space\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nThe **sample space** $S$ is the set of *all* outcomes\n:::\n:::\n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Event\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nAn **event** is a *collection of some* outcomes. An event can include multiple outcomes or no outcomes (a subset of the sample space).\n:::\n:::\n\nWhen thinking about events, think about outcomes that you might be asking the probability of. For example, what is the probability that you get a heads and a tails in one flip?

However, other letters might be chosen to be more descriptive.\n\n \n\n-   We use the notation $|S|$ to denote the **size** of the sample space.\n\n \n\n-   The total number of possible events is $2^{|S|}$, which is the total number of possible subsets of $S$. \n\n \n\n-   The **empty set**, denoted by $\\emptyset$, is the set containing no outcomes.\n\n## Example: Keep sampling until...\n\n**Suppose you keep sampling people until you have someone with high blood pressure (BP)**\n\n \n\n**What is the sample space?**\n\n-   Let $H =$ denote someone with high BP.\n\n-   Let $H^C =$ denote someone with not high blood pressure, such as low or regular BP.\n\n \n\n-   Then, $S =$\n\n# Set Theory\n\n## Set Theory (1/2)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n \n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Union\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nThe **union** of events $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \\cup B$, contains all outcomes that are in $A$ *or* $B$ or both\n:::\n:::\n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Intersection\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nThe **intersection** of events $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \\cap B$, contains all outcomes that are both in $A$ *and* $B$.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nVenn diagrams\n:::\n:::\n\n## Set Theory (2/2)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n \n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Complement\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nThe **complement** of event $A$, denoted by $A^C$ or $A'$, contains all outcomes in the sample space $S$ that are *not* in $A$ .\n:::\n:::\n\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nDefinition: Mutually Exclusive\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\nEvents $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive**, or disjoint, if they have no outcomes in common.
