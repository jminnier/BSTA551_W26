(1/2)\n\n- We hear the word \"probability\" pretty often\n  - Common in news reports, advertisements, sports, medicine, etc. \n  \n> Researchers say the *probability* of living past 110 is on the rise\n>\n> [CNBC, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/17/study-living-past-110-is-becoming-more-likely-longevity-tips.html)\n  \n- We may hear \"probability\" or similar words like \"chance,\" \"likelihood,\" or \"odds\"\n\n> Scientists fine-tune *odds* of asteroid Bennu hitting Earth through 2300 with NASA probe’s help\n>\n> [Space.com, 2021](https://www.space.com/asteroid-bennu-osiris-rex-impact-odds)\n\n## Before we take one more step\n\n- The following few slides *use some undefined words* to **define new words** that in turn *define the previously undefined words*\n- It's confusing! \n- We're going off assumption that we all have some daily understanding of probability, so stop me if you are confused!\n\n![](./images/Math_Lady_meme.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n::: lob\n1.

(next slide!)\n\n\n## Why are simulations important? (bigger picture)\n\nIn the previous example, coding a simulation seemed more educational than necessary\n\n \n\n1. Simulations can help us (or be necessary) to **solve a problem when calculations are complex**\n    - We can often calculate probabilities mathematically, but we will eventually get to complex calculations \n\n2. Simulations are a great way to **check your work**!\n\n\n3. Simulation based **reasoning** is helpful in statistics\n    - You'll see this in confidence intervals in Biostatistics courses\n\n    \n4. Simulations allow you to **change assumptions easily** and see how they affect your results\n\n\n5. It is often **how statisticians \"run\" experiments** on their methods of hypotheses\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n1.

However, other letters might be chosen to be more descriptive.\n    - Examples: $A, B, C, A_1, A_2$\n\n- We can also define a new event as a combination of other events (**next lesson**)\n    - Examples: $A \\cup B$ (union), $A \\cap B$ (intersection), $A^C$ (complement)\n\n \n\n-   We use the notation $|S|$ to denote the **size** of the sample space.\n\n \n\n-   The total number of possible events is $2^{|S|}$, which is the total number of possible subsets of $S$. \n\n \n\n-   The **empty set**, denoted by $\\emptyset$, is the set containing no outcomes.\n\n## Example: Keep sampling until... {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Suppose you keep sampling people until you have someone with high blood pressure (BP)**\n\n \n\n**What is the sample space?**\n\n-   Let $H =$ denote someone with high BP.\n\n-   Let $H^C =$ denote someone with not high blood pressure, such as low or regular BP.\n\n \n\n-   Then, $S =$\n\n## Let's define probability with events and spaces\n\nIf $S$ is a finite sample space, with [**equally likely**]{style=\"color:#d9534f;\"} **outcomes**, then\n\n$$\\mathbb{P}(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|}$$\n\nIn human speak: \n\n- For [**equally likely**]{style=\"color:#d9534f;\"} **outcomes**, the probability that a certain event occurs is: the number of outcomes within the event of interest ($|A|$) **divided by** the total number of possible outcomes ($|S|$)\n\n$$\\mathbb{P}(A) = \\frac{\\text{total number of outcomes in event A}}{\\text{total number of outcomes in sample space}}$$\n\n- Thus, it is important to be able to count the outcomes within an event\n\n## A probability is a function...\n\n- $\\mathbb{P}(A)$ is a function with\n\n    -   **Input:** event $A$ from the sample space $S$, ($A \\subseteq S$)\n\n        - $A \\subseteq S$ means \"A contained within S\" or \"A is a subset of S\"\n\n    -   **Output:** a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive)\n    \n \n\n- The [**probability function**]{style=\"color:#E25D3B;\"} maps an event (input) to value between 0 and 1 (output)\n\n  - When we speak of the probability function, we often call the values between 0 and 1 \"probabilities\"\n  \n    - Example: \"The probability of drawing a heart is 0.25\" for $P(\\text{heart}) = 0.25$ \n\n \n\n- The probability function needs to follow some specific rules (called axioms)!\n\n## Coin Toss Example Revisited: 2 coins\n\n-   From our sample space and events:\n    -   Sample space: $S = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$\n\n    -   Event A: $A = \\text{exactly one H} = \\{HT, TH\\}$\n\n    -   Event B: $B = \\text{at least one H} = \\{HT, TH, HH\\}$\n\n \n\n- Calculate $P(A)$ and $P(B)$\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n1.
