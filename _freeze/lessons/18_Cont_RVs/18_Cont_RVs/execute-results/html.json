Distinguish between Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, and Normal distributions when\n    reading a story.\n2.  Identify the variable and the parameters in a story, and state what\n    the variable and parameters mean.\n3.  Use the formulas for the pdf/CDF, expected value, and variance to\n    answer questions and find probabilities.\n    \n## Where are we?\n\n![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Chapter 31: Uniform RVs\n\n## Properties of continuous uniform RVs\n\n-   **Scenario:** Events are equally likely to happen anywhere or anytime in an interval of values\n\n-   Shorthand: $X \\sim \\text{U}[a,b]$\n\n$$\nf_X(x) = \\dfrac{1}{b-a}, \\text{ for }a \\leq x \\leq b\n$$\n\n$$\nF_X(x) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            0 & \\quad x<a \\quad \\\\\n            \\dfrac{x-a}{b-a} & \\quad a \\leq x \\leq b\\quad \\\\\n            1 & \\quad x>b \\quad\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n$$\n\n$$\\text{E}(X) = \\dfrac{a+b}{2} \\text{, } \\text{ Var}(X) = \\dfrac{(b-a)^2}{12}$$\n\n## Identifying continuous uniform RV from word problems\n\n-   Look for some indication that all events are **equally likely**\n\n    -   Could also say \"uniformly distributed\"\n\n-   Look for an interval\n\n    -   **Time example:** Costumer in your store will approach the cash register in next 30 minutes. Approaching the register throughout the 30 minutes is equally likely.\n\n    -   **Length example:** You have a 12 inch string that you need to cut. You are equally likely to cut anywhere on the string.\n\n-   Different than the discrete uniform\n\n    -   Discrete usually includes a *countable* number of events that are equally likely\n\n    -   Continuous is not countable\n\n        -   Exact time and length can be measured with infinite decimal places\n\n## Helpful R code\n\nLet's say we're looking at equally likely arrival times between 10 am and 11 am.\n\n-   If we want to know the probability that someone arrives at 10:30am or earlier:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    punif(q = 30, min = 0, max = 60)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 0.5\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to know the time, say $t$, where the probability of arriving at $t$ or earlier is 0.35:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    qunif(p = 0.35, min = 0, max = 60)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 21\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to know the probability that someone arrives between 10:14 and 10:16 am:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    punif(q = 16, min = 0, max = 60) - punif(q = 14, min = 0, max = 60)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 0.03333333\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to sample 20 arrival times from the distribution:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 60)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n     [1] 36.1518032 56.6547857 45.1115403 51.8594366 34.8732771 12.8750386\n     [7] 42.5877139 44.3007376 56.7688498 30.0011219 54.6299942 12.6420043\n    [13] 44.1304846 19.9011956 28.5120543  5.4834140 31.0400753 46.8370057\n    [19] 35.1252265  0.9729805\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n## Bird on a wire (TB 31.5)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n::: example\n::: ex-title\nExample 1\n:::\n\n::: ex-cont\nA bird lands at a location that is Uniformly distributed along an electrical wire of length 150 feet.
