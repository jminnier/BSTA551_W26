The Adobe Scan phone app is an easy way to scan photos and compile into a PDF. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.\n\n*You must show all of your work to receive credit.*\n\nExtra problems do not need to be turned in!\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  The following table shows the results of a survey in which the subjects were a sample of 300 adults residing in a certain metropolitan area. Each subject was asked to indicate which of three policies they favored with respect to smoking in public places. (Table is from *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*, 10th Edition, Daniel, Wayne W.; Cross, Chad L., pg. 630)\n\n    ![](Table_Smoking_vs_Education_Level.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"6in\"}\n\n    Let $X=$ highest education level and $Y=$ policy favored. We can let $X=1$ for college graduate, $X=2$ for high-school graduate, etc., and similarly for $Y$, or just keep the category names for the different levels of $X$ and $Y$\n\n    a.  Make a table for the joint pmf $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n    b.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n    c.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n    d.  Make a table for the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n    e.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n    f.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.\n\n3.  Let $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ be i.i.d. random variables with common pdf $f_X(x)$ and cdf $F_X(x)$. Find the pdf for the random variable $Z$, where $Z = \\max(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$.\n\n2.  Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with respective pdf's $f_X(x)=\\frac{1}{5}$, for $0\\leq x\\leq 5$, and $f_Y(y)=2e^{-2y}$, for $y>0$.\n\n    a.  Find the joint distribution $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$.\n    b.  Find the probability that $X$ is less than $Y$.\n    c.  Let $Z$ be the random variable that is the smaller of $X$ and $Y$. Find the cumulative distribution function for $Z$.\n    d.  Find the pdf for Z.\n\n3.  Suppose that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ have joint density $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$, for $0<x<1$, and $\\frac{1}{2}<y<1$. Set up the equation for the cdf of $Z$, where $Z=X/Y$.\n\n    *Hint: First determine what the possible values for* $Z$ are. Then make a sketch of the domain of the joint pdf and shade in the region representing the cdf of Z for different values of $z$. Make sure to pay close attention to how the region we need to integrate over changes as $z$ changes. The cdf has two different cases depending on the value of $z$. Plug in specific values of $z$ and shade in the region representing the cdf to see why two different cases are needed.\n    \n## Extra problems\n\n1. Freddy and Jane have entered a game in which they each win between 0 and 2 dollars. If X is the amount Freddy wins, and Y is the amount that Jane wins, they believe that the joint density of their winnings will be $$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\dfrac{1}{4}xy \\text{ for } 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\text{ and } 0 \\leq y \\leq 2$$ and $f_{X,Y}(x, y) = 0$ otherwise. Find the probability that their combined winnings exceed 2, i.e., find $P(X + Y > 2)$.",
