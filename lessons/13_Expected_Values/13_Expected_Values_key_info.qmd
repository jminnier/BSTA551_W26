## Announcements

- Quiz 2 back: everyone got at least a 12/14! Woo!
  - Most common mistake: Question 10 - the fact that $f_X(x)$ can be greater than 1 is:
    - **Wrong answer**: Invalid, because a pdf (like a probability) can never be greater than 1
    - **Correct answer**: Valid, because the *area* under the curve from 0 to 1 is 1, even if the *height* of the function is greater than 1
- Feel free to use your no-questions-asked extensions on homework
  - And remember that there is no **grade** penalty for turning in homework late
    - Charles is not obligated to give you feedback though
- Sadly, there is no audio in the class on 11/5
  - Not sure if human error or computer issue

## Key Dates
