::: proof-cont
The **expected value** of a **discrete RV** $X$ that takes on values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_ip_X(x_i)$$ where $n$ can be $\infty$

The **expected value** of a **continuous RV** $X$ is $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf_X(x) dx$$ where we adjust the integrand based on the bounds of $X$

-   Expected values are not necessarily an actual outcome
    -   In previous example, we cannot roll a 3.5
    -   It could be that our expected value is not in the sample space ($E(X) \notin S$)

Suppose I throw darts at a dartboard until I hit the bullseye, and that my probability of hitting the bullseye is $p$.

## Ghost! 👻 {visibility="hidden"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 6
:::

::: ex-cont
A ghost is trick-or-treating. It comes to a house where it is known that there are 30 candies in the bag and only one is a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which is the ghost's favorite. The ghost takes pieces of candy without replacement until it gets the watermelon Jolly Rancher. How many pieces of candy do we expect the ghost to take?
:::
:::
Can we model this with a distribution?
:::

:::

## Some remarks on last two examples {visibility="hidden"}

Both examples are repeated random processes. They are fundamentally different though:

-   The bullseye example is "*with replacement*" since the probability of success remains constant.

-   The ghost trick-or-treating example is *without replacement*, and thus the probability of success changes with each trial.

## Sums of Random Variables

::: definition
::: def-title
Theorem: Sum of random variables
:::

::: def-cont
For RVs (discrete or continuous) $X_i$ and constants $a_i$, $i=1,2,\dots, n$, $$\mathbb{E}\Bigg[\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i\Bigg] = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\mathbb{E}[X_i] .$$ **Remark:** The theorem holds for infinitely RV's $X_i$ as well.
:::
:::

-   For two RVs, $X$ and $Y$:
    -   We can say $E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$
    -   ... and constant numbers $a$ and $b$, we can also say $E[aX+bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]$
    -   We can also also say $E[X-Y] = E[X] - E[Y]$, since $b=-1$

## Expected value of one RV from joint pdf

If you have a joint distribution $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and want to calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$,
you have two options:

1.  Find $f_X(x)$ and use it to calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

2.  Calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$ using the joint density:
    $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f_{X,Y}(x,y)dydx.$$
    
    
You can do the same for $\mathbb{E}[Y]$!

## Option 1: Find marginal first

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 9
:::
::: ex-cont
Let $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= 2e^{-(x+y)}$, for
$0 \leq x \leq y$. Find $\mathbb{E}[X]$.
:::
:::


:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Do this one at home by finding $f_X(x)$ then $\mathbb{E}[X] = \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf_X(x) dx$. See if you get the same result as next page's answer!
