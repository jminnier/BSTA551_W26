For events:

$$P(A | B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

## How do we represent independent RVs in a joint pmf/pdf?

**What do we know about independence for events?**

For events: If $A \perp B$

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$ $$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

$$F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_{X}(x)F_{Y}(y)$$ $$p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p_{X}(x)$$
$$p_{Y|X}(y|x) = p_{Y}(y)$$

For a valid joint pmf, we need:

-   $0 \geq p_{X,Y}(x,y) \leq 1$ for all $x, y$
-   $\sum \limits_{\{all\ x\}} \sum \limits_{\{all\ y\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)=1$

For a valid conditional pmf, we need:

-   $0 \geq p_{X|Y}(x|y) \leq 1$ for all $x, y$
-   $\sum \limits_{\{all\ x\}} p_{X|Y}(x|y)=1$

For a valid joint pdf, we need:

-   $f_{X,Y}(x,y)\geq 0$ for all $x,y$
-   $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy=1$

For a valid conditional pdf, we need:

- $f_{X|Y}(x|y)\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $y$
- $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X|Y}(x|y)dx =1$

## Extra notes

-   If $X_1, X_2, …, X_n$ are **independent**

$$p_{X_1, X_2, …, X_n}(x_1, x_2, …, x_n) = P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, …, X_n=x_n)=\prod\limits_{i=1}^np_{X_i}(x_i)$$
$$f_{X_1, X_2, …, X_n}(x_1, x_2, …, x_n) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^nf_{X_i}(x_i)$$
$$F_{X_1, X_2, …, X_n}(x_1, x_2, …, x_n) = P(X_1\leq x_1, X_2\leq x_2, …, X_n\leq x_n)=\prod\limits_{i=1}^nP(X_i \leq x_i) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^nF_{X_i}(x_i)$$

- Don't forget, you can manipulate the conditional density to get the joint: $$f_{X,Y}(x,y)= f_{X|Y}(x|y)f_Y(y)$$

<font size=6ex>Remark:

-   To show that $X$ and $Y$ are *not* independent, we just need to find one counter example
-   However, to show that they *are* independent, we need to verify this for all possible pairs of $x$ and $y$

## Final statement on independence

1.  If $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= g(x)h(y)$, where $g(x)$ and $h(y)$ are pdf's, then
    $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

    -   The domain of the joint pdf needs to be independent as well!!
    
 
 
 
 

2.  If $F_{X,Y}(x,y)= G(x)H(y)$, where $G(x)$ and $H(y)$ are cdf's, then
    $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

    -   The domain of the joint CDF needs to be independent as well!!
    
 
 
 
 
    
- Make sure that:
  - $X$ domain does NOT depend on $Y$
  - $Y$ domain does NOT depend on $X$
