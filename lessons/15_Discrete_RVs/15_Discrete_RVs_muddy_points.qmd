## Fall 2025

### 1. Hypergeometric distribution is always a lot to look at

Haha, so true. Hopefully more examples next class will be helpful.

### 2. For the first couple of random variable types deriving the expected values & variances feels simple enough, for the later ones i have no idea how

Yes, it gets tricky especially when $X$ can take infinite values. The good news is these are all very common random variables and there are many videos that go through the proofs. 

For example, [here is one from Khan Academy on the geometric distribution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7br_-emGNec)
