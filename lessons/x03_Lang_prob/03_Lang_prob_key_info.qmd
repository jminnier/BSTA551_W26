## Announcements

- Q: Can we still turn in exit tickets even if its not the same day? For example I was here the first day but forgot to do the exit ticket, if I did it today would it still count towards my grade?
  - Yes! I check them for "attendance" after 7 (sometimes more) days after the class

- For muddy points, it really helps if you can asked a specific question about what you found confusing
  - I can then address it in a more targeted way
