## Structure for this course

-   Learning the basic tools to understand statistics
    -   This is the first quarter that I am adding simulations
    -   So I rearranged a lot of the topics!

 

-   It is going to feel useless at times, but I swear it is not!

 

-   This class will help you build a toolbox that allows you to analyze data while understanding the inner theory at play
-   You can use probability and simulations to change your analysis as you need
