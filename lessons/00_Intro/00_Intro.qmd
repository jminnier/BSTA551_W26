## Decision on Homework due dates

-   I have some set due dates in the schedule

-   Please look at your other classes, your calendar, etc

-   Consider what day of the week you would like to turn in your assignments

-   Question in HW 0 to cast your vote and share your opinion

## Structure for this course

-   Learning the basic tools to understand statistics
    - This is the first quarter that I am adding simulations
    - So I rearranged a lot of the topics!

 

-   It is going to feel useless at times, but I swear it is not!

 

-   This class will help you build a toolbox that allows you to analyze data while understanding the inner theory at play
  - You can use probability and simulations to change your analysis as you need
