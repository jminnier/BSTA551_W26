## Structure for this course

-   Statistics is based on mathematics, which has theoretical underpinnings.

-   Understanding the "why" behind why we perform certain hypothesis tests and where our estimates come from.

-   Think of this course as paired with the applied courses. There may be a lot of overlap, but we are going deeper with the "why" and "how"

-   This used to be two quarters of material, with more proofs and much more calculus. I tried to make this course more digestible in 10 weeks, while also including some simulation/boostrap/permutation methods. Therefore: topics will go by quickly!! We won't have time to prove most things, you will have to take a lot of this on face value.

 

-   I agree with Dr. Wakim: "It is going to feel useless at times, but I swear it is not!"

## What we will cover

-   Point Estimation
-   Hypothesis Testing
-   Confidence Interval Estimation
-   Asymptotic properties of estimators/tests
-   Bootstrap/resampling methods
