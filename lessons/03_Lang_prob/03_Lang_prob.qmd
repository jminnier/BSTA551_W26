We're going to roll two four-sided dice. **This time, let's say event A is rolling matching numbers and event B is rolling at least one 2.**

## Probability Axioms

::::::::::::: columns
:::::::::::: column
::::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 1
:::

::: axiom-cont
For every event $A$, $0\leq\mathbb{P}(A)\leq 1$. Probability is between 0 and 1.
:::
:::::

::::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 2
:::

::: axiom-cont

:::
:::::

::::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 3
:::

::: axiom-cont
If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$, is a collection of **disjoint** events, then $$\mathbb{P}\Big( \bigcup \limits_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\Big) =  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A_i).$$ The probability of at least one $A_i$ is the sum of the individual probabilities of each.

## Some final remarks on these proposition

-   Notice how we spliced events into multiple **disjoint** events
    -   It is often easier to work with disjoint events

 

-   If we want to calculate the probability for one event, we may need to get creative with how we manipulate other events and the sample space
    -   Helps us use any incomplete information we have

## De Morgan's Laws

::::: theorem

Theorem: De Morgan's 1st Law
:::

::: thm-cont
For a collection of events (sets) $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$

$$\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i^C = \Big(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i\Big)^C$$
:::
:::::

"all not A = $($at least one event A$)^C$" or "intersection of the complements is the complement of the union"

::::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem: De Morgan's 2nd Law
:::

::: thm-cont
For a collection of events (sets) $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$

$$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i^C = \Big(\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i\Big)^C$$
:::
:::::

"at least one event not A = $($all A$)^C$" or "union of complements is complement of the intersection"

## BP example variation (1/3)

-   Suppose you have $n$ subjects in a study.

-   Let $H_i$ be the event that person $i$ has high BP, for $i=1\ldots n$.

 

*Use set theory notation to denote the following events:*

1.  Event subject $i$ does not have high BP

2.  Event all $n$ subjects have high BP

3.  Event at least one subject has high BP

4.  Event all of them do not have high BP

5.  Event at least one subject does not have high BP

## BP example variation (2/3)

-   Suppose you have $n$ subjects in a study.

-   Let $H_i$ be the event that person $i$ has high BP, for $i=1\ldots n$.

*Use set theory notation to denote the following events:*

1.  Event subject $i$ does not have high BP

     

2.  Event all $n$ subjects have high BP

     

     

3.  Event at least one subject has high BP

## BP example variation (3/3)

4.  Event all of them do not have high BP

     

     

     

5.  Event at least one subject does not have high BP

## Remarks on De Morgan's Laws

-   These laws also hold for infinite collections of events.

     

-   Draw Venn diagrams to convince yourself that these are true!

     

-   These laws are *very* useful when calculating probabilities.

    -   This is because calculating the probability of the **intersection of events is often much easier than the union of events**.

    -   This is not obvious right now, but we will see in the coming chapters why.

## Partitions

::::::::::: columns
::::::::: {.column width="60%"}
::::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Partition
:::

::: def-cont
A set of events $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ create a **partition** of $A$, if

-   the $A_i$'s are disjoint (mutually exclusive) and

-   $\bigcup \limits_{i=1}^n A_i = A$
:::
:::::

::::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
-   If $A \subset B$, then $\{A, B \cap A^C\}$ is a partition of $B$.

-   If $S = \bigcup \limits_{i=1}^n A_i$, and the $A_i$'s are disjoint, then the $A_i$'s are a partition of the sample space.
:::
:::::
:::::::::

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::::::::::

Creating partitions is sometimes used to help calculate probabilities, since by Axiom 3 we can add the probabilities of disjoint events.

then find the probability of them taking their medication exactly one of the two weeks.
