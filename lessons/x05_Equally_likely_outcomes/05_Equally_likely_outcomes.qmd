## Learning Objectives

1.  Define permutations and combinations

2.  Characterize difference between sampling with and without replacement

3.  Characterize difference between sampling when order matters and when order does not matter

4.  Calculate the probability of sampling any combination of the following: *with or without replacement* and *order does or does not matter*

## Where are we?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(here)
source(here("class_dates.R"))
```

```{css}
#| echo: false

<style>
#wrap { width: 600px; height: 390px; padding: 0; overflow: hidden; }
#frame { width: 1300px; height: 600px; border: 1px solid black; }
#frame { zoom: 1.5; -moz-transform: scale(1.5); -moz-transform-origin: 0 0; }
</style>

Example 1

::: ex-cont
Suppose we have 10 (distinguishable) subjects for study.

1.  How many possible ways are there to order them?

2.  How many ways to order them if we can reuse the same subject and

    -   need 10 total?

    -   need 6 total?

3.  How many ways to order them *without replacement* and only need 6?

4.  How many ways to choose 6 subjects without replacement if the order doesn't matter?

# Permutations and Combinations

## Permutations and Combinations

::::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Permutations
:::

::: def-cont
**Permutations** are the number of ways to **arrange in order** $r$ distinct objects when there are $n$ total.

$$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
:::
:::::

::::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Combinations
:::

::: def-cont
**Combinations** are the number of ways to choose (**order doesn't matter**) $r$ objects from $n$ without replacement.

$$nCr = \textrm{"n choose r"} = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$
:::
:::::

## Some combinations properties

| Property |   | Proof |
|:-----------------:|--|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| $$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$$ |  | $\binom{n}{r} = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ and $\binom{n}{n-r} = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!(n-(n-r))!} = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$ |
| $$\binom{n}{1} = n$$ |  | $$\binom{n}{1} = \dfrac{n!}{1!(n-1)!}=\dfrac{n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots1}{1! \cdot (n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots1} = \dfrac{n\cdot(n-1)!}{1\cdot (n-1)!} = \dfrac{n}{1}=n$$ |
| $$\binom{n}{0} = 1$$ |  | $$\binom{n}{0} = \dfrac{n!}{0!(n-0)!}=\dfrac{n!}{1\cdot n!} = 1$$ |

# More Examples: order matters vs. not

## Table of different cases

-   $n$ = total number of objects

-   $r$ = number objects needed

    |   | with replacement | without replacement |
    |-------------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------------:|
    | **order matters** | $$n^r$$ | $$n\text{P}r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$ |
    | **order doesn't matter** | $$ \binom{n+r-1}{r}$$ | $$n\text{C}r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$ |

## Enumerating Events and Sample Space

-   Recall, $P(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|S|}$
    -   Within combinatorics, we can use the previous equations to help enumerate the event and sample space
    -   But $A$ might be a combination of enumerations

 

-   For example in the following example drawing 2 spades when order does not matter, we actually need to enumerate the other cards that are NOT spades. So the event is choosing 2 spades out of 13 AND choosing 0 other cards of 39 cards (13 hearts + 13 clubs + 13 diamonds).

-   Thus the probability is actually:

$$ P(\text{two spades}) = \dfrac{{13 \choose 2}{39 \choose 0}}{{52 \choose 2}} $$

-   Note that $13 + 39 = 52$ and $2+ 0 = 2$. So the numerator's $n$'s add up to the denominator's $n$ and the numerator's $r$'s add up to the denominator's $r$'s

Suppose we draw 2 cards from a standard deck without replacement. What is the probability that both are spades when

1.  order matters?
2.  order doesn't matter?

We can do a simulation!

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(1234)
n_sim <- 1000000
cards = c(rep("S", 13), 
          rep("H", 13), 
          rep("C", 13), 
          rep("D", 13))
draws <- replicate(n_sim, 
                   sample(cards, 2, replace = FALSE))
draws[, 1:10]

spades_2 = sum( draws[1, ] == "S" & draws[2, ] == "S" )
spades_2 / n_sim
```
